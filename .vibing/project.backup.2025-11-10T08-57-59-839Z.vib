  "concept": "A structured reasoning system for analyzing complex, high-stakes scenarios through systematic deconstruction. The system operates in three phases: (1) Surface Premise Analysis - identifies dominant public assumptions and baseline narratives, (2) Deep Questioning - exposes hidden fragilities, blind spots, and unstated dependencies through rigorous interrogation, and (3) Counterfactual Generation - explores alternative outcomes across six strategic axes by forcing breach conditions and mapping potential strategic consequences. Designed to challenge conventional wisdom and reveal non-obvious risk vectors in critical decision-making contexts. 5 step is strategic outcome \n",
