  "title": "Taiwan Strait Crisis Escalation",
  "description": "A military standoff in the Taiwan Strait has escalated following a series of increasingly aggressive Chinese military exercises and U.S. naval deployments. Key assumptions include that both sides seek to avoid direct confrontation, that regional allies will maintain their current positions, that economic interdependence will serve as a deterrent, and that international diplomatic channels remain open and effective. The prevailing expectation is that both sides will de-escalate through backchannel negotiations while maintaining public postures of strength.",
