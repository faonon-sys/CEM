Updated .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files\n2. Created render.yaml with deployment configuration\n3. Generated requirements.txt with project dependencies\n4. Updated README.md with Render deployment instructions\n5. Added a TodoWrite task list for deployment tracking\n\nKey deployment configuration:\n- Runtime: Python\n- Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n- Start Command: `python backend/main.py`\n\nRecommended next steps:\n1. Create GitHub repository\n2. Push code to the repository\n3. Connect repository to Render\n4.
